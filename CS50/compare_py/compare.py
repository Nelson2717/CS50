# This code is a simple program that compares two strings, s and t, entered by the user.
# It takes the user's input for both strings and checks if they are equal.
# If the strings are the same, it prints "Same"; otherwise, it prints "Different".
# The program is case-sensitive, meaning "hello" and "Hello" would be considered different strings.
# This program is useful for basic string comparison tasks, such as checking for equality or differences.
# To improve the program, you could add additional features such as:
