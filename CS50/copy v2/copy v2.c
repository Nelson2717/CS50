// This program copies the contents of one file to another byte by byte.
// It uses the standard input/output functions from the C library to read and write data.
// The program opens the source file in binary read mode and the destination file in binary write mode.
// It uses a while loop to read one byte at a time from the source file and write it to the destination file.
// The program demonstrates how to handle file input and output in C, as well as how to work with binary data.
// The program is a simple example of how to use standard file I/O functions in C to copy data from one file to another.
// It also shows how to use the fread and fwrite functions to read and write binary data, which is important for handling files that contain non-text data.
// The program is a simple demonstration of how to handle file input and output in C, as well as how to work with binary data. It also shows how to use the fread and fwrite functions to read and write binary data, which is important for handling files that contain non-text data.
// The program also includes error handling for file operations, which is important for ensuring that the program runs correctly and does not crash due to file issues.
