# The code defines a simple Flask web application with two routes: the root route ("/") and a POST route.
# The root route handles both GET and POST requests.
# If the request method is POST, it renders a template called "greet.html" and passes the user's name
# (obtained from the form data) to the template. If no name is provided, it defaults to "world".
# If the request method is GET, it renders a template called "index.html".
# The application uses the Flask framework to create a web server and handle HTTP requests.
# The `render_template` function is used to render HTML templates with dynamic content.
# The application is useful for creating a simple web page where users can enter their names
# and receive a personalized greeting.
# To run the application, you would typically execute the script and access it in a web browser.
# The application is designed to be run in a development environment, and you may need to set the FLASK_APP
# environment variable to the name of this script before running it.
