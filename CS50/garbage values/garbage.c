// This code declares an array of integers and prints the values in the array.
// It uses a for loop to iterate through the array and print each value.
// The program demonstrates how to declare and initialize an array in C, as well as how to use a loop to access and print the values in the array.
// The program is a simple example of how to use arrays and loops in C to store and manipulate data.
// It also shows how to use the printf function to print values to the console.
