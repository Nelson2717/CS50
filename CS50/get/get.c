// This code allocates memory for a string, reads a string from the user, and then prints it.
// It uses the malloc function to allocate memory for the string and the scanf function to read the string from the user.
// The program demonstrates how to handle string input and output in C, as well as how to work with dynamic memory allocation using malloc and free.
// The program is a simple example of how to use standard input and output functions in C to read and manipulate strings.
// It also shows how to use the scanf function to read strings safely and how to manipulate strings using functions like strcspn.
// The program is a simple demonstration of how to handle string input and output in C, as well as how to work with dynamic memory allocation. It also shows how to use the scanf function to read strings safely and how to manipulate strings using functions like strcspn.
// The program also includes error handling for memory allocation using malloc, which is important for ensuring that the program runs correctly and does not crash due to memory issues.
