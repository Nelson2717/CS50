// This program prints the command-line arguments passed to it.
// It uses the argc parameter to get the number of arguments and the argv parameter to access the arguments themselves.
// The program demonstrates how to handle command-line arguments in C, which is a common way to pass input to a program when it is executed.
// The program is a simple example of how to use command-line arguments in C to get input from the user.
// It also shows how to use a loop to iterate through the arguments and print them one by one.

// The program also includes error handling for the number of arguments, which is important for ensuring that the program runs correctly and does not crash due to incorrect input.
