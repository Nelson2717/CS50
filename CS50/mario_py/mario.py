# This code prompts the user for a positive integer input and prints that number of "#" characters.
# The code uses a while loop to repeatedly ask for input until a valid positive integer is provided.
# The for loop then prints the "#" character the specified number of times.
# The code is a simple demonstration of loops and input handling in Python.
