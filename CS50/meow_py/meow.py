main()

# This code defines a function called `meow` that takes an integer `n` as an argument.
# The function prints the string "meow" `n` times.
# The code also includes a `main` function that calls the `meow` function with the argument 3.
# The `main` function is called at the end of the script to execute the code.
# The code is a simple demonstration of defining and calling functions in Python.
